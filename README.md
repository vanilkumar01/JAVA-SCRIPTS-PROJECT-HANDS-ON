ands-On Real-Time JavaScript Projects with REST API Integration
This file showcases multiple real-world frontend projects built using vanilla JavaScript, integrating REST APIs for dynamic, data-driven functionality. Each project includes:

Responsive UI built with HTML & styled using CSS

JavaScript logic for interactivity, DOM manipulation, and client-side routing

REST API integration for fetching, posting, and updating live or mock data (e.g., weather data, user inputs, product info)

Real-time apps like to-do managers, weather dashboards, and user forms with API connectivity

Clean, modular code optimized for reusability and scalability

Demonstrates strong frontend engineering skills with live data handling, async logic (fetch/async-await), and API-driven user experiences â€” ready for production-grade web development.
